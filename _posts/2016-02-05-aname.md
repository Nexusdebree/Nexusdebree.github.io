title: Better Software for 3D Animation!!
---

See from my point of view i would really prefer you  [Maya](http://www.autodesk.in/products/maya/overview) 
***PAID***but the thing is just that you just have to learn to use that software as it has little conmplex 
controls and also its hot keys are very typical so it can be hard for beginers to learn that but once you
have learned all the functions the result will be qiute better than others .Next i would prefer you the most
popular one [Adobe Photoshhop](http://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop.html) ***PAID***The world's best 
imaging and design app is at the core of almost every creative project. Work across desktop and mobile devices
to create and enhance designs including websites and mobile app, 3D artwork, 3d vedios. and more!!!
Next i would like to prefer you a qite light software [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)***FREE***
It is a very quite light software so you can use it i do prefer  using blender as its very easy to learn
and it gives good results .
**So  its your choice which software you want to choose But some are paid and some are free so take care regarding that **
