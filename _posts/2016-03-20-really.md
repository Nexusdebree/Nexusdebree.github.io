title: Is that really true?????
---

Guys i heard a quote that **Bueaty lies in simplycity** When we se it in context to ***Males*** it almost proves to be 
right . But when we see in context to ***Females*** it somewhere went wrong . Around 1 hour ago i went to a wedding 
and there what i saw is really a funny thing for me . I know wedding is a respectable thing and people are fond of 
wearing clothes and especially ladies for makeup and all that thing . When i see myself i was too simple infront of them
but when i looked around mostly men were simply clothed but ladies and girls wre in their full fashion **Tons of heavy makeup**
and lots of jwellery and after standing at a stall  of a food ...................... 

sorry for incompletion .......
