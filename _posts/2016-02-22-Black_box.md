Guys atension atension I am having a news it can  be **Good** for some and also **Bad** for some !!!!!!!!

Some people connected to me have reported me that they **haven't got any confirmation message** for payment option
so don't get tensed many people like us have not got that message as i said in my earlier post that **7 Crore** entries
have been registered but unfortunately 25 Lakhs** people can have a golden chance to get that phone . But don't feel sad 
about it I have researched that the date they have given i.e. **30th June** They will not be able to come  over their 
dead line as till noww not more than **5 lakhs** devices have been made so fell happy people who have ordered will 
only have regret as they wasted their time to book that shit . and if you really wana buy that phone then start 
collecting that money because according to them ~ ***Ringing Bells*** they will relaunch the phone with its orignal price
i.e. around **3000 Rs** ya tthat's more but a satisfactory price that you have bought something real . so once again 
don't feel sad if you are . ***Takecare***

**Stay tuned for more ..!!!!!!!!!**
