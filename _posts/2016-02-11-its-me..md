title: Life of "Programmer"
---


'Hi' - It is the very common word that you listen from most of the people around you is'nt it offcource  
because it is the common way to start a conversation with anyone on any topic .

But wait !!!!!!! Do you know the person whom you are saying 'Hi' can be  a programmer of !!!Whatsapp!!!!!
ofcource he can be . because while a new app comes or a new software comes you are only knowing about the 
orginising company or the owner of that app or that software but don't you think everything that works on computer 
needs a **coding** yes it is !! every interface needs an code and do you know who is that coder or say that code
builder - No!! I think you have never ever thought about that .

Thats what is a life of a Programmmer they lives with you but you don't even know wheater he/she is a programmer
or not. they dont have their identity and also they are not so much pretended to show that they are  programmer
But when you see their life its full of thoughts that you may never even heard .Now you are thinking that they are bound 
to sommething but no they are enjoying their life .
