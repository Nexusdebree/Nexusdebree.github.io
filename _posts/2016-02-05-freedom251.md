Guys !!! its unbeliveable . A **Android** Phone  with **LOLIPOP 5.1** 1Gb ram 5Gb useable memmory
in just 251 rs or just 4 $ hmm its truth . its not **fake** accutally its an trick .
see A company name **Adcom** I hope you know  yup acctually see when we buy a phone 
they offer us some discount but this phones price is taken from discounted one and also one thing this thing is 
created on private level this thing dosen't contain any Gov. subsidy so its not fake as see this [vedio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j53KpEZSkWA) you can see 
as the adcom written on back pannel is covered by our flag sticker and see the stupidness in its offficial releasse 
they have used ***whitenner** as they can  do nothing for the adcom written on its front face due to glass so i assure its not ***Fake***
.Noww process to order As this phone is so cheap so people are dying to buys it acc to report it was around 6lacs hits per second 
so if you fail  to open web page just keep on and on trying you will succeed every page  just try again 
if it says to contineu with same  information click **contineu** and buy it . after it the phone no. you have 
entered will recive a message within 48 hours and also payment confirmation onn email id according to some
people it has **COD** option and charges 40 rs extra for it and if you wana save it better online payment.
Don't  worry you if you dont get delivery because its delivery dates are till 30th June so keep waiting till then.
