---

Guys have you ever thought that the phone behind which you are running like a hunter can you get it . 
Think! Think!! I hope you are thinking that  you are paying for it so for sure you will get .
Na Read it before thinking that :

All the people of India like you  have spent their time  on booking it . But have you thought you are 
dying after a 250 Rs or 4$ phone which has no gaurranty that you will get it or not . Acccording  to
a report around 5 crore registrations were done and goverment has decided that only 25 Lakhs people
could get this phone. seriously Its true . Ringing Bells claim 25 Lakhs booking , but phones yet to 
started being made. Its a long boring waiting process to get the phone you have to wait till 30th
of June . Oh My God !!!! Isn't it a looong wait . But till now we are not sure that we are geting
or not . wait !! around 3 Days ago on Their [official website](www.freedom251.com) i sent a message
and they replied to get in touch with me shortly -By Freedom 251 Team but till now i haven't got 
any reply from then .Their shortly is very long what to do!!  Keep Waiting !!!! But some have't got
their confirmation link so What's in your life Keep Waiting for this **Shit**

Thankyou....

Stay tuned for more!!!!!!!!!
